SUGGESTED TIMELINE: 3 WEEKS

1.
  Derive  the  appropriate  direct  and  inverse  kinematic  equations  for  your
arm.  Create a list of test cases that your model and code must meet
(i.e.  avoiding singularities)
2.
  Implement your equations using the framework java simulation for your
arm  that  has  been  provided.   Test  how  well  your  model  code  performs
against the requirements dened in the lab script and make any necessary
improvements.
3.
  Deploy the code from your simulation onto hardware.  Show that it passes
all necessary test cases.  Arm performance in drawing pictures judged by
Arthur.

WEEK 1 SUMMARY (12/9-18/9)
 - Completed Kinematic equations
 - Impletmented most of equations into java
 - Found positions of motors (put in java)
